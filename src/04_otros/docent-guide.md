## Basic Information about the Course

Fundamentals of Informatics aims to ensure that students understand the basic concepts related to programming, can analyze specific problems, solve them, and develop programs that yield corresponding results on a computer. Additionally, students will learn to use and become familiar with a technological environment for program development.

These objectives are aligned with some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) and specific targets, such that the acquisition of the learning outcomes of the course will contribute, to some extent, to achieving goal 9.1 of SDG 9.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand basic concepts related to programming and informatics.
- Comprehend, analyze, and solve information processing problems of low or medium complexity.
- Define the most appropriate data structures to represent the information associated with each problem.
- Design and construct algorithmic actions that solve each problem efficiently and effectively.
- Understand basic problems and algorithms for processing sequential and indexed data structures.
- Understand the syntax and semantics of basic constructions in a programming language.
- Write programs with good style, proper documentation, precise comments, and correct specifications.
- Use editing, compilation, debugging, and execution tools to develop programs.
- Apply strategies to correct programs when they do not function properly.
- Develop and execute programs on a computer in a specified programming language.

## Evaluation System

First Exam Period: The evaluation is based on the following tests:

- P1. Test where each student must answer questions and solve exercises and problems. It may be required to be done on a computer or in writing. A minimum score of 5.0 is required to pass the course. If this minimum score is achieved, the test will account for 70% of the final grade. Otherwise, the score of this test will be the recorded grade.

- P2. Programming assignments using a computer. These assignments account for 30% of the final grade. Each student must submit the programming assignments within the established deadlines. The assessment will consider the functionality according to specifications, the quality of design and presentation, the proper application of resolution methods, the time spent, and the ability to explain and justify the design. The faculty will indicate whether the programming problems in the assignments should be done individually or in teams.

- P3. Practical and individual programming exam. This is an alternative global test to P2 for students who have not completed the programming assignments or have not achieved an adequate level. Students can choose to take this exam, and by doing so, they waive their P2 grade irreversibly. The practical exam will present programming exercises similar to those done in practice or seen in class, to be solved on a computer within a set time. It will be graded from 0 to 10, considering the correct functioning and performance of the programs, the quality of design, and the proper application of resolution methods.

Second Exam Period: Evaluation is based on tests analogous to P1 and P3 of the first exam period, with the same weightings and minimum score requirements. The grades obtained in the first period for any tests (P1 and P2/P3) are retained for the second period unless the student opts to retake the corresponding test, in which case the new grade will prevail.
